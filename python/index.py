# you steal cakes. you broke into a cake vault
# there are unlimited supply of cakes in there but only a limited type of cakes
# cakes are represented as

# tuple of ints (0, 1), where 0 is weight of cake (kilos) and 1 is the monetary value of cake (shilling)

# you brought a duffle. it can only carry x amount of weight.
# you want to make off with the most amount of money by stealing cake

# write a func that takes a list of cake tuples and a duffle weight capacity,
# and return the maximum monetary value one can steal with duffle.
#

# example: max_duffle_bag_value(30, [(7, 160), (3, 90), (2, 15)])

# brute force
